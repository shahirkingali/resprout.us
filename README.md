# Resprout.Us
As a student-led company, we are committed to democratizing access and diversifying the tech industry contributors. In keeping with our values and our commitment to fostering a more inclusive, non-exploitative tech ecosystem, we welcome members of diverse populations, socioeconomic status, and career paths. We believe that the focus of startup readiness is more than a set of skills or experiences; it is a mindset paired with passion.  You are a great candidate even if youâ€™ve never worked in a startup because we know that it has always been a matter of connecting people with resources to mobilize their passion and achieve their envisioned journeys and outcomes. We encourage members of traditionally underrepresented and underserved communities to apply, including women, BIPOC people, undocumented/DACAmented/mixed status people, immigrant people, rural people, formerly incarcerated people, LGBTQ+ people, veterans, people with different abilities in the disability community, elders, and established professionals looking to make a career transition.
